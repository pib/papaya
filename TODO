TODO:
 * add support for generator functions (if it has a YIELD instruction, it's a generator)
 * Make the first co_consts item either a doc-comment or None as per the
   documentation. This also means that doc-comments should be supported.
 * Use Opcode objects as intermediate code for both assembly and disassembly, so that Opcode
   objects can be generated from a different source (a compiler, of course)
 * general cleanup
 * Unit tests
   
DONE:
 * add *args and **kwargs support
 * Encode CALL_FUNCTION parameters as the comma separated counts of positional
   args and keyword args, rather than the single number it is now
 * add support for specifying the name of a function
 * Fix disassemble() to handle *args and **kwargs
